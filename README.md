# CS50 Finance - My Version

## Overview
This project is an implementation of CS50's "Finance" problem set, which allows users to manage a virtual stock portfolio. It includes features such as buying and selling stocks, viewing transaction history, and checking stock prices. Additionally, I have implemented:

- **Deposit Feature**: Users can add virtual cash to their account.
- **AJAX-based Stock Quotes**: Stock prices are fetched dynamically without page reloads.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in securely.
- **Buy & Sell Stocks**: Users can purchase stocks based on real-time prices and sell them later.
- **Transaction History**: Displays a record of all trades.
- **Portfolio Overview**: Shows current holdings and account balance.
- **Deposit Cash**: Users can increase their balance by adding virtual money (magically!).
- **Live Stock Quotes (AJAX)**: Stock quotes are retrieved dynamically without refreshing the page.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Flask for backend)
- **SQLite** (Database for user accounts and transactions)
- **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap** (Frontend UI)
- **JavaScript (AJAX, Fetch API)** (For fetching stock prices asynchronously)
- **API** (Used for fetching stock data)

## Custom Features Implementation
### Deposit Feature
- Users can add funds via a **Deposit** button.

- The new balance is displayed in the portfolio.

### AJAX-based Stock Quotes
- Used JavaScript `fetch()` to get real-time stock data from the API.
- Updates stock information without reloading the page.

## Future Improvements
- Implement user authentication with OAuth (e.g., Google Login).
- Improve UI with more interactive elements.
- Add email notifications for portfolio changes.
